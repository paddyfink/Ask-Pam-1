# Gustav Chatbot for Conference

## Introduction ##

> Innovation starts with identifying a need, problem, or opportunity, and then making the effort to translate an idea into a solution that provides value for our clients.  This means we need to go beyond developing ideas and find the motivation to put in the hard work. And for an innovation to be considered viable, it must be replicable at an economical cost and must satisfy a specific need, big enough to make an impact. This factor comes alongside the vision, and its importance cannot be underestimated.

*Pam Alfred, Founder and CEO of Ask PAM, http://www.ask-pam.com/innovation-concierges-weak-spot*

The problem Pam and her team need to solve is a communication and scale bottleneck between Concierges and their clients. She sought to improve and facilitate communication by adding new technology to the process that would also help concierges grow their businesses and reputation. 

To that end, we are embarking on a hackathon to augment concierge efficiency and responsiveness by building a bot to propose or recommend answers for questions sent from the attendees/customers of a concierge.
 
Key technologies used:
* Azure Web App Services
* Azure DocumentDB
* Cognitive Services (LUIS, QnA Maker)
* Bot Framework
* Xamarin / C#
* Node.js
* VS Code

The team was comprised of technical evangelists from Microsoft DX and
developers from Ask PAM's backend and client developer teams.

## Customer profile ##

ASK PAM is a unified multi-channel messaging web app which allow any hospitality organizations to respond, support and engage with customers using popular messaging apps, SMS, websites and mobile apps.

Customers expect to engage with companies using their preferred communication channels that will vary from one situation to another. Consistent, personalized and real-time conversations not only save customers time but also improve the overall experience. Loyalty and revenue increase as customers enjoy their overal experience.

Today, Ask PAM is working with 5-star hotels and international business conferences such as C2 Montreal. They also are in discussion with airports, airline companies and banks to facilitate their customer/concierge departments. 

http://www.ask-pam.com

Ask PAM agreed to collaborate with Microsoft on this project for several reasons:
1. Ask PAM management had a pre-existing relationship with a Microsoft Canada DX evangelist.
2. Ask PAM is a member of the BizSpark program and therefore are familiar with Microsoft programs and benefits.
3. Ask PAM's technology stack is predominantly based on Microsoft technologies.
4. And Finally, their CTO, Patrick Finken, was a consultant specialized in MS technologies with numerous MCTS certifications prior to his role at Ask PAM.

 
## Problem Statement ##

Concierges, group coordinators, sales & operations, etc. need to answer questions from attendees/customers and other staff members before, during and after an event based on a knowledge base collected over time.

Currently, there is no automated way to share that information and those question/answer pairs.  The lack of communication between the concierges and other staff members results in lower responsiveness and efficiency and a decline in customer/attendee experience satisfaction.

Ask PAM directly integrated into messaging platforms (messaging apps, SMS, websites and mobile apps) and uses its hub, which contains a knowledge base and event information, to enable concierges to service their customer/attendees at the events.

## Project Objectives: Solution, Steps, and Delivery ##

The solution we envisionned to help Ask PAM's concierges answer questions quickly and at scale was an assistant chatbot powered by their internal Ask PAM hub. 

A bot will be prototyped with LUIS, the Bot Framework and the QnA Maker. The bot will first attempt to understand the intent behind a message it receives from the Ask PAM hub. This message might be sent by a conference attendee, hotel guests, etc. to a concierge. If the bot will ask LUIS if it recognizes an intent from the message with a sufficiently high score, it will formulate a dynamic response. If the LUIS returns with a low score, the bot will then ask the QnA Maker for a potential answer from a knowledge base that is fed by the Ask PAM hub. If the QnA Maker does not have a sufficiently good answer with a high enough score, the bot will then hand off the message to a concierge without replying back to the user. 

The concierge will then have the conversation and message flagged in both Ask PAM's web interface and the Xamarin app developed as part of this hackathon. The concierge will then be able to edit the answer or send it directly to the attendee.

Further, the Xamarin application that was developed that contains an interface to all the bot conversations so that concierges can answer questions if the bot does not have sufficient answer and monitor all the conversations taking place.

### Architecture Overview

After much discussions with the Ask PAM developer team, we established the following application architecture.

<img src="https://rntpsg-dm2pap001.files.1drv.com/y4mIuYK2JkthwXjmi09hjb72rZKrC7jrbRLIDw5I6dPQhuBFwDnh0wWmc_Ku9Db4rhH8JY-f7e_iYpbTA2BX21u0uduWmlQ02ZXO5lugvvkzzY6FD9ROFEStvYWrzvhN_eTRdCfd6fXfKKzLUx6C6HhNHpI1esSjXwWidZmAmkMBlzzzcV3DgeYWmXebSTbfQ4fv4YY7a7-vBpoXSGPRK7HgQ?width=2038&height=1233&cropmode=none" />

The conference attendees, hotel customers, etc that want to interact with a bot will first message an Ask PAM concierge using SMS or Facebook or a custom mobile app developed for that specific Ask PAM client or through a chat widget embedded in a website. This message is then relayed using the Smooch service to the Ask PAM Hub. The Ask PAM Hub is responsible for passing the conversation to a bot or assigning the conversations to a specific Concierge (who may have an existing relationship) and identifying the user with the Ask PAM CRM system. The Hub is an internal software developed by Ask PAM developers. If the Hub determines that it should pass this conversation to the Bot Framework, it will open a DirectLine to the Bot Framework and pass the question. The Hub will then listen for a response from the Bot Framework (either from LUIS or from the QnA Maker), the Bot will directly post all message to a storage database for further analysis and reply to the DirectLine client with the response. If the Bot can not find a suitable answer, it will post to an API in the Hub to notify it that it needs human assistance. 

The Hub will then flag the conversation so that Concierges are notified that they are needed to answer a customer message. The Concierges can either see flagged messages using the Xamarin app or through Ask PAM's existing web interface.

### Bot Framework 

#### Architecture 

The core bot functionality was built leveraging the Bot Builder SDK with Node.js. The bot leverages LUIS to attempt to understand the intent behind the message and formulate a dynamic answer. The bot leverages the Knowledge Base design pattern, where in this case the knowledge base is supplied by the QnA Maker and the data is fed directly from the Ask PAM Hub. Finally, the bot follows the bot-to-human handoff pattern by setting a flag on the conversation when the bot is unable to answer the message.

#### Dialog Hierarchy

It was determined that the Bot Builder dialogs will be setup in the following hierarchy. The first dialog to be executed is the LUIS Intent Dialog which will attempt to recognize an intent already registered with LUIS. If there is no intent recognized, the dialog starts a new QnA Dialog. If the new QnA dialog also fails to find a suitable answer to the message, it will will also be replaced by the human dialog which will pass control back to a human through an API call to the Ask PAM Hub. 

```
BOT CONTROL -> ('/', luisDialog) -> ('/qna', qnaDialog) -> ('/human', humanDialog) -> HUMAN CONTROL
```

If the LUIS dialog understands the intent of the message, it will formulate an answer and no new dialog is started. If the QnA Dialog does find an answer, the control is then sent back to the LUIS dialog to understand future messages.

```
BOT CONTROL -> ('/', luisDialog) -> ('/qna', qnaDialog) -> ('/', luisDialog) -> BOT CONTROL
```

The human dialog has the purpose of sending a message to the user to alert them that they are now being passed on to a human and also calls the message flag API call.

The bot will use the `replaceDialog()` instead of the `beginDialog` when there is no expectation that control will be returned back to the calling dialog. For example, if control will be passed back to a human, the call to replace the Dialog stack is done to ensure that in no way will control be passed back to the bot code.

#### LUIS Dialog and LUIS Training Methodology

The LUIS Intent Dialog handles several intents and will be the root dialog of the conversation bot. The LUIS Model URL is taken from the `process.env` object that has all the system Environment Variables. In development mode, we are using the "dotenv" module to load the URLs directly in the `process.env` object, see section "Environment Variable Loading" for more information. The `LuisRecognizer` is passed the `LUIS_MODEL_URL` and the object is created into the `recognizer` variable. The `recognizer` variable is passed to the IntentDialog object as one of the recognizers. This `dialog` object will allow us to register event handlers for each intent.

```js
// Create LUIS recognizer that points at our model and add it as the root '/' dialog for our Cortana Bot.
var model = process.env.LUIS_MODEL_URL;
var recognizer = new builder.LuisRecognizer(model);
var dialog = new builder.IntentDialog({ recognizers: [recognizer] });
```

This dialog handles the following intents:

* GoToHuman: This intent recognizes a message asking for a human (a Concierge) and will begin the Human Dialog which passes control to a human. 
* Greeting: This intent is meant to recognize a greeting message such as "hello" or "hi".
* GetSpeakerSchedule: This intent is meant to recognize a message asking for a specific speaker's schedule at a conference. 
* GetEventTopic: This intent is meant to recognize a message asking for the topics at this event or conference. 
* GetSpeakerInfo: This intent is meant to recognize a message asking for the biography or a description of a specific speaker.
* GetEventLocation: This intent is meant to recognize a message asking for an address or the location of an event or a specific session.

The GoToHuman intent will begin the human dialog: 

```js
dialog.matches('GoToHuman', [
  function(session, args, next){
    session.beginDialog('/human');
  }
]);
```

The Greeting intent will send a message through the session variable that's passed into the dialog handling waterfall function. Note: the `persistBotMessage` is a custom function implemented by the team that persists all the messages sent by the bot to an external MongoDb database, see the "Bot Message Persistance" section.

```js 
dialog.matches('Greeting', [
  function(session, args, next) {
    session.send(persistBotMessage(session, "Hi, I am Gustav. I am a bot. If I can't answer your question, \
I will pass it to my human colleagues. They are a little slower \
to repond so please be patient. How can I help you?"));
  }
])
```

In the next example, we will handle the GetSpeakerSchedule intent, this is the only intent for which the entire code is shared. The proprietary code to access the Ask PAM Hub has been replaced with TODO comments. The code sample has been annotated to explain what each line is doing and add references to sections in this document.

```js
// Tell the 
dialog.matches('GetSpeakerSchedule', [
  function(session, args, next){
      // Save LUIS results for further analysis, see section "Logging LUIS and QnA Maker Results for Future Analysis"
      session.userData.LOGDATA.LUIS = args;

      // Check if the score for this intent is high enough, if not go to the QnA Dialog.
      if(args.score < 0.5) {
        session.beginDialog('/qna');
        return;
      }

      // Resolve and store any entities passed from LUIS.
      var speaker_name = builder.EntityRecognizer.findEntity(args.entities, 'speaker name');

      session.dialogData.session_format = builder.EntityRecognizer.findEntity(args.entities, 'session format');

      // Check if all the information we need is available, if not promt the user
      // to fill in the rest of the needed information.
      if(speaker_name === undefined || speaker_name === null){
        session.dialogData.speaker_name = null;
        builder.Prompts.text(session, "What is the speaker name?");     
      } else {
        // If we have all the information we need, move to the next step in the waterfall.
        session.dialogData.speaker_name = speaker_name;
        next();
      }
  },
  function(session, results, next) {
    // Retrieve all the information we collected from LUIS or the user.
    var sn_entity = session.dialogData.speaker_name;
    var sf_entity = session.dialogData.session_format;

    // Ensure it's not null or undefined. 
    var speaker_name = (sn_entity === undefined || sn_entity === null) && results.response ? 
      results.response : sn_entity.entity;
    var session_format = sf_entity !== undefined && sf_entity !== null ? 
      sf_entity.entity : null;

    // Inform the user that we are thinking on an answer.
    session.sendTyping();

    //TODO: The actual API call is hidden but basically it will return an answer for this query.
    var answer = "";
    if(session_format){
      answer = `${speaker_name}'s ${session_format} is on Wednesday at 3pm`;
    } else {
      answer = `${speaker_name} is on Wednesday at 3pm`;
    }
    // Send the session code 
    session.send(persistBotMessage(session, answer));
    // Use the logging function to log the LUIS data for future analysis. 
    log(session, session.userData.LOGDATA.LUIS, null, answer, true);

    // A special function to end the conversation but also notify the Ask PAM Hub.
    endGlobalConversation(session);
```

The LUIS dialog will begin the QnA dialog if LUIS returns the None intent i.e. it doesn't recognize any specific intent.

```js
// If LUIS doesn't recognize the intent, go to the QNA maker. 
dialog.onDefault(function (session, args, next) {
    session.userData.LOGDATA.LUIS = args;
    session.beginDialog('/qna');
});
```

The LUIS dialog is set to be the `module.exports` so that the dialog can be imported by another module that registers it as part of the bot. 

```js
module.exports = dialog;
```

#### QnA Maker Dialog

The QnA Maker will query the the API with the message sent to the user. This HTTP POST API request is sent using the "request" node module. The array of functions that would form the bot dialog waterfall is exported from the module so that it may be loaded in the server code to be registered as a dialog. Further, the QnA Maker URL, Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key and the Knowledge Base ID are loaded from the `process.env` object containing the system Environment Variables. See the annotated code below:

```js
module.exports = [
    function (session, args, next) {
      // Tell the user we are working on an answer by sending the typing command.
      session.sendTyping();

      // Extract the question from the message.
      var q = session.message.text;

      // Submit a post request to the QnA Maker for an answer.
      request.post({
        method: "post",
        url: process.env.QNAMAKER_URL + "/knowledgebases/" + process.env.QNAMAKER_KBID + "/generateAnswer", 
        headers: {
          "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key": process.env.QNAMAKER_SUBKEY
        },
        json: {question: q}
      }, function(error, response, body){
        // Check if there is an error or the answer has a confidence value higher than 50%.
        if(error || body.score < 50) {
          // We don't know the answer so send to a human.
          session.userData.LOGDATA.QNA = body;
          session.replaceDialog('/human');
          return;
        } else {
          // Send the answer and persist it to the database.
          session.send(persistBotMessage(session, body.answer));
          // Log the values of the LUIS and QnA maker results for further analysis.
          log(session, session.userData.LOGDATA.LUIS, body, body.answer, true);
          // A special function to end the conversation but also notify the Ask PAM Hub.
          endGlobalConversation(session);
        }
      });
    }
];
```

#### Human Dialog

The Human Dialog simply notifies the user that the conversation will pass to a human Concierge.

```js
module.exports = [
    function (session, args, next) {
      // Send the answer and persist it to the database.
      session.send(persistBotMessage(session, "Sorry, I can't help you with that. Let me find one of my human colleagues. Please hold on."));
      // Log the values of the LUIS and QnA maker results for further analysis.
      log(session, session.userData.LOGDATA.LUIS, session.userData.LOGDATA.QNA, null, false);
      //Call Ask PAM Hub to pass to human. 
      endGlobalConversation(session);
    }
];
```

#### Bot Message Persistance 

Per a request from the Ask PAM team, they wanted to log all the bot messages to an external database so that they may integrate the bot responses into other parts of their application. This is a simple wrapper function that writes to a DocumentDB (through the MongoDb API) and returns the original message. The function uses the "request" module to send a HTTP POST request to the message.

```js
var request = require('request');

exports.persistBotMessage = function(session, message){
  request.post({
    url: //ASK PAM API URL
    json: {
      botconversationId: session.message.address.conversation.id,
      message: message
    }
  }, function(error, response, body){
    if(error) {
      console.error(error);
    }
  });
  return message;
}
```

#### Logging LUIS and QnA Maker Results for Future Analysis

Per a request from the Ask PAM Team, they also wanted to log all the results for the intents and the QnA Maker confidence score so that they can determine how to improve their LUIS intents and what question-answer pairs they need to add to the QnA Maker. Also, by measuring cases where LUIS or the QnA Maker should have been more confident in their answers, they will improve those services. 

It was also required to record both the LUIS and QnA Maker results for the same messages (if both services were needed). The `session.userData` object was used to retain the results as it is persisted across dialogs until the bot code hits an endpoint (either by moving to a human or returning a result). 

To reset the data for the log for a new message from the user, the `session.userData.LOGDATA` object was cleared on the beginning of the LUIS intent dialog as that is the root dialog of the bot.

```js
dialog.onBegin(function(session, args, next){
  session.userData.LOGDATA = {};
  next();
})
```

When it comes time to log the results (after collecting either the LUIS results or both LUIS and QnA Maker results) to the DocumentDB database, the following function was created that constructs an object with the timestamp of the message, the conversation ID, the original message, the reply message of the bot, whether the message was answered and the LUIS or QNA results.

```js
exports.logConversation = function(session, luis, qna, reply_message, answered) {
  var o = {
    time : session.message.timestamp,
    conversation_id: session.message.address.conversation.id,
    message: session.message.text,
    reply_message: reply_message ? reply_message: null, // null is when human should reply
    answered: (answered !== false && (qna || luis)) ? true : false,
    qna: qna ? qna : null,
    luis: luis ? luis : null
  };

  MongoClient.connect(process.env.DOCDB_CONNECTIONSTRING, function(err, db) {
    // Get the collection
    var col = db.collection('bot_msg_log');
    col.insertOne(o, function(err, r) {
      // Finish up test
      db.close();
    });
  });  
}
```

This funciton will log the conversation results and in a non-blocking way allowing the bot to continue execution.

#### Server Code using Restify

All the server code including the code to bootstrap the Restify server was placed in a server.js file at the top level folder. This file also bootstrapped the ChatConnector and UniversalBot objects from the BotBuilder SDK ChatConnector while also loading the required Dialog objects from node modules in the dialogs folder using the Node Module Require and Loading system. 

The following code loads the "restify" module using the node module loading system into a variable called restify. A server is then created using the `createServer()` function into the `server` variable. The `server` is then informed to listen on a port as assigned by a `port` or `PORT` environment variable or in the case that those variables are null, it would default to 3978.

```js
var restify = require('restify');

// Setup Restify Server
var server = restify.createServer();
server.listen(process.env.port || process.env.PORT || 3978, function() {
    console.log('%s listening to %s', server.name, server.url);
});
```

The following code loads the BotBuilder SDK and will load the `luisDialog`, `qnaDialog` and `humandDialog` objects from the dialog code in the dialogs folder.

```js
var builder = require('botbuilder');
var luisDialog = require('./dialogs/luis');
var qnaDialog = require('./dialogs/qna');
var humanDialog = require('./dialogs/human');
```

A `ChatConnector` object is created and provided with a `MICROSOFT_APP_ID` and `MICROSOFT_APP_PASSWORD` keys if they are present in the `process.env` object which holds the system's Environment Variables.

```js
// Create chat bot
var connector = new builder.ChatConnector({
    appId: process.env.MICROSOFT_APP_ID,
    appPassword: process.env.MICROSOFT_APP_PASSWORD
});
```

A `UniversalBot` object is then created and each dialog object that was exported is then added to the bot with the correct the url/name assigned to it. In this way, we can split up the dialog code across multiple modules and reduce the amount of code present in each source file.

```js
var bot = new builder.UniversalBot(connector);
bot.dialog('/', luisDialog);
bot.dialog('/qna', qnaDialog);
bot.dialog('/human', humanDialog);
```

Lastly, we inform the Restify server to listen for HTTP POST requests on the url '/api/messages' and pass those requests to the ChatConnector object. 

```js
server.post('/api/messages', connector.listen());
```

#### package.json

The package.json lists all the dependencies of the bot (as expected for all node.js projects). The scripts object is also setup so that when the command `npm start` is executed then server.js file will be executed.

```json
{
  "name": "gustav",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "main": "server.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "botbuilder": "^3.7.0",
    "dotenv": "^4.0.0",
    "mongodb": "^2.2.25",
    "request": "^2.81.0",
    "restify": "^4.3.0"
  }
}
```

#### Environment Variable Loading

There are many subscription keys and URLs for the various services that need to be loaded by the Bot to be able to access the Ask PAM Hub APIs, the LUIS API and the QnA Maker API. The most effective way to load all the needed key-value pairs was from the System Environment Variables. These key-value pairs can be set in the settings of the Azure Web App Service wherer they can be accessed from any part of the Bot code. 

For development purposes, the "dotenv" node module was used to be able to load the same key-value pairs directly from a .env file instead of having to manually set them up on each developer machine. The "dotenv" node module would load the environment variables from the .env file into the 'process.env' variable in Node.

The following code sample shows how to call the "dotenv" node module to load a .env file if it exists and it shows how to access an environment variable from 'process.env'. 

```js 
// Load ENV variables
require('dotenv').load();

var model = process.env.LUIS_MODEL_URL;
```

### Xamarin Mobile App
The Ask PAM mobile app will be used by staff members to continue the conversation with an event attendee when the bot is unable to answer a question.

#### Tools and Technologies Used
* Xamarin/Xamarin.Forms (C#)
* Azure Notification Hub	
* Conversation Hub (SignalR)
* Ask PAM Web API
    * Dev/Test: https://askpamcrm-qa.azurewebsites.net 
    * Prod: https://app.ask-pam.com
* Visual Studio Mobile Dev Center 
    * Continuous Integration (CI) Builds
    * Crash Reporting
    * Analytics Tracking

The implementation of these technologies is detailed in the following sections.

#### DevOps
The source code for this application is stored in BitBucket, and associated to 2 app entries in Ask PAM’s Visual Studio Mobile Center account – one for the Xamarin.Android project and the second for the Xamarin.iOS project. Whenever a commit is pushed to master, a CI build is triggered for both the Android and iOS projects. Automated testing and distribution through Mobile Center were not configured during the Ascend+ hack.

#### Architecture Overview
The mobile app was developed using Xamarin and C#, targeting Android and iOS.  The user interface was designed using Xamarin.Forms. The Model-View-ViewModel architecture pattern was used to enforce a separation of the user interface (i.e. the View) from the underlying data (i.e. the Model), and to facilitate the use of data binding between the View and the ViewModel. 

The application contains 3 projects: 
1. AskPam.csproj – Portable Class Library which contains the majority of the application code, including the Views, Models, ViewModels, Services, Interface Definitions, Value Converters, and Helper classes.
2. AskPam.Droid.csproj  - platform-specific project for Android, containing Xamarin.Forms initialization, broadcast receiver registration,  helper classes, and custom renderers.
3. AskPam.iOS.csproj  - platform-specific project for iOS, containing Xamarin.Forms initialization, helper classes, and custom renderers.

The app currently supports English only, but the solution was designed to use resource files in order to support localization. All string labels within the app are retrieved from the AppResources file in the Portable Class Library. Platform-specific helper classes were developed for Android and iOS to detect the device’s current locale to enable the proper resource file to be loaded.
The app is configured to use the Dev/Test host for the Ask-PAM Web API calls when compiling in Debug mode, and to use the Prod host when compiling in Release mode. All Web API calls are invoked over HTTPS. All Web API calls are performed as asynchronous operations so as not to block the UI thread when waiting for a response.
Development and manual testing for this Ascend+ was focused more on the Android platform, than on the iOS platform. As a result, the following is a list of outstanding items on the iOS end:

1. Push notification registration
2. End-to-end testing on iOS simulator and/or device

#### App Initialization
When the application is launched, registration with Visual Studio Mobile Center is performed for analytics and crash reporting. 
Xamarin.Auth is an open-source cross platform library for securely storing user account data. It is used within the Ask-PAM mobile application to check the AccountStore (ie. secured local data store) for an existing user account record and a token. If a token does not exist in the AccountStore, the application loads the login view. If a token does exist, the application bypasses the login view to display the conversations list.

#### Login View
When the application is launched, a check is performed in the AccountStore for a user account and token. If the token does not exist, the login view is displayed as depicted below.

<img src="https://m9hhtq-dm2pap001.files.1drv.com/y4mU32ontVt_qS7pJqyXh90d-kMpCKnyiJtCyurMzWjSg8baB0axK_TcIOJQULwfe6nAzj80I6EM1k5S0UyDr8ha9PqUK1P07wPVLI1Vh60PIdyQanfGUAqT_9o3HfuTyx0kspycHc04JR_Qt0zZuFLrljiE9HTznYyGwCk77KOdDVxkvQZIKgCEkzsJFuBrFDq12p9UBjYCyxhQ_P2ZByaLQ?width=414&height=711&cropmode=none"/>

Figure 1 – Login View

In this view, the user has the option to exit the application by pressing the back button or continue within the application by entering his/her credentials in the provided fields then tapping the Login button.

Upon selecting the Login button, the web API call, {Ask-PAM Request URI}/Account/Login, is invoked to authenticate the user, passing along the credentials in the request body as a JSON string.

If a successful response is returned from the server, the JSON result is deserialized as an AuthInfo object, returning an auth token and the organization Id of the current user.

A new Account is then created in the AccountStore for the current user. AuthInfo.IdToken, AuthInfo.OrganizationId, and the Username entered during login are all saved to the Account. The app then navigates to the Conversations List, and removes the Login view from the Navigation Stack history.

Note that the token and organization Id is used in subsequent web API calls within the application,  appended as default request headers.

Within the Android project, a notification broadcast receiver is initialized to register for push notifications, with the current User Id and Organization Id set as tags. This has yet to be implemented for the iOS application.

If a non-successful response is returned from the server, the app remains in the Login view until the user exits the app or is able to retry the login with valid credentials.

#### Conversations List

The Conversations List view is comprised of the following:
1.  List of conversations
2.  Filter selections
3.  Search bar
4.  Logout option

Upon navigating to the Conversations List view, the web API call, {Ask-PAM Request URI}/Conversations/GetFilters, is invoked to retrieve the list of filter options. The collection returned from the Web API call is represented in the Conversations List view as a secondary menu.

The conversations list is retrieved through a call to the web API, {Ask-PAM Request URI}/Conversations/GetConversationsList, with a maximum result count of 20 conversation items specified as part of the request, as shown in Figure 2.

This web API call also expects search and filter parameters, if any are specified. Each time a filter option is selected or a search is triggered by the user in the Conversations List view, the same API call, {Ask-PAM Request URI}/Conversations/GetConversationsList, is invoked including the search and/or filter options as part of the request. Similarly, when the search criteria and/or filter is cleared, the call is invoked again to request the list without filters.

Tapping the search icon in the title bar toggles between making a search field visible and hidden, as shown below

Figure 3 – Search field displayed

When the search field is visible, the user is able to enter search criteria. Tapping the search button in the virtual keyboard will execute the search through the web API, as discussed earlier.

Selecting the ellipsis for the secondary menu exposes the list of available filter options, and a Logout menu option, as shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 – Secondary Menu With Filter and Logout Options

Selecting a filter option invokes the web API call, as mentioned earlier, to request a filtered list of conversation items.

The JSON result that is returned is deserialized into an ObservableRangeCollection of ConversationList objects, which is displayed in the view whenever the collection has changed.

Tapping any item in the conversation list will navigate to the conversation view for the selected conversation.

Selecting the Logout option from the secondary menu will delete the user’s Account from the AccountStore, and trigger a navigation to the Login page. The Conversations List view will be removed from the Navigation Stack history.

#### Selected Conversation View
The Selected Conversation view is comprised of the following:
1.  Assign To dropdown list
2.  Bot On/Off toggle
3.  Conversation list
4.  Chat field with Send button

Upon navigating to the Conversation view, a web API call to, {Ask-PAM Request URI}/Conversations/ GetConversation, appending the conversation Id as part of the query string. The API returns a JSON of the conversation history, which is deserialized as an ObservableCollection of Conversation items and displayed in the Conversation view.

Also, a server-to-client SignalR connection to the Conversation Hub is initiated using the user Id, organization Id, and platform type as the query string for the connection. When a message is associated to the conversation on the server-side, an OnMessageReceived event is invoked on the client side, passing the conversation message to the client, which is added to an ObservableCollection of Message items and displayed in the Conversation list. The list automatically scrolls to the bottom when a the collection of conversation items is updated so that the user is able to view the most recent conversation item.

Furthermore, the web API call, {Ask-PAM Request URI}/User/GetAllUsers, is invoked to retrieve a list of staff members. The resulting JSON is deserialized into an ObservableCollection of Users which is used to populate the Assign To dropdown list.

The user can assign a conversation to another staff member by selecting them in the Assign To dropdown list. Selecting a user in this list invokes a web API call, {Ask-PAM Request URI}/Conversations/AssignToUser, passing along the current conversation Id and selected User Id to the request. The action to Assign To User on the server triggers a push notification through the Azure Notification Hub. The push notification is received on the device. The current implementation sends out the notification to all registered devices. There is still work to be done to ensure that the notification is attributes tags to it such that only the selected user that received the conversation assignment will receive the push notification.

Toggling the Bot On/Off switch invokes a web API call, {Ask-PAM Request URI}/Conversations/EnableBot, passing in the conversation Id. When the bog is toggled off, it is supposed to indicate to the server that the conversation is being taken over by the current user. When the bot is toggled on, this is ultimately supposed to enable hand-off of the conversation back to the bot. However, I don’t believe this was fully functional on the server side as part of the hack.

The user may respond to the conversation by typing in a message in the chat field and tapping the Send button. Sending a message invokes a web API call, {Ask-PAM Request URI}/Conversations/SendMessage, passing along the conversation Id and message text in the request.

Pressing the back button from the Conversation view will return the user to the Conversation List view.

## Customer Testimonials ##


> Working with the Hackathon team from Microsoft was a great learning experience. Having access to an experienced programmer who also knew the Microsoft Bot Framework, QnA Maker and LUIS technologies well, significantly reduced the learning curve for the project and allowed us to write a functional bot in just a couple of days. Looking at what we were able to achieve in such a short time, after just an intro to these technologies, is highly motivating and really puts in perspective what can be accomplished going forward.

*Alex Ruaux, Developer at Ask PAM*

> The business opportunity for a start-up like ours is very valuable. At first we were not sure about the benefits for Ask-PAM and now I wish we could do this type of Hackathon every time we are thinking of implementing new features with unknown technologies.

> We received great support from the Microsoft team to determine realistic goals for the ascend. And because of their experience with the different tools, the team was able to quickly move toward the right direction and define the best way to achieve our objectives. During the hackathon, we faced some challenges that could have take us weeks to figure out. In 4 days, we were able to deliver a fully functional prototype that we could test in beta with potential clients. This will help us decide if there is a real need for our existing clients and better understand the value as they are using a live product. Those 4 days helped us see the potential of the different offers by Microsoft. In this case, it was the QnA Maker, Luis and Xamarin. We have now a better understanding of the benefits and limitations of each technology which will help us better plan and deliver new features

*Pamela Alfred, Founder and CEO of Ask PAM*


> I had a really great time with the Microsoft team, Lori was really efficient and helpful every time I had a question. The most challenging part when it comes to building a new app is the configuration and deciding what are the best technologies to use to optimize the development. The Hackathon has been great for that! It was also a great opportunity to discover new technologies never used up to now such as AI. I m ready to do it again!

*Cedric Arnould, Developer at Ask PAM*

> Let’s be honest, before the beginning of the hackathon, I was a little bit skeptical. I was wondering how we would be able to build a Bot and a mobile application in just 4 days. But we did and it was a great experience. The project itself brought a lot of value to the business and the team because it was a real challenge that we were facing with one of our client. We have now a clear vision on the path to take to build and deliver an intelligent based on AI.
> 
> Furthermore, working with Microsoft experts has facilitated the learning process and the experience brought valuable knowledge on cutting edge technology.
> 
> As the CTO of Ask PAM, the hackathon reassured me with the decision to use mainly Microsoft as our main technologies provider. The integration with our current system was really smooth and seamless and the time to market really fast. We are already experimenting the bot with a client, and with some adjustments it will be ready for a general release.

*Patrick Finken, Co-founder & CTO at Ask PAM*

## Conclusion ##

As we mentioned in the beginning, concierges, group coordinators, sales & operations, etc. need to answer questions from attendees/customers and other staff members before, during and after an event based on a knowledge base collected over time. The bot we created in this hackathon does just that.  Furthermore the mobile application we created to support the concierges, offers an interface to all the bot conversations so that they can answer questions if the bot does not have sufficient answer and monitor all the conversations taking place. And feed that back into the Q&A database.

This will solve the communication and scale bottlenecks between Concierges and their clients and allow them to be more efficient.

The solution is to be deployed in production as soon as the testing is complete.
